So I tried to migrate my Rails app from Heroku to Fly.io and successfully failed again and again.
Before moveing to Fly.io, I tried Dokku, which I knew the older versions before, but didn't work on Lightsail.
It worked on EC2, so might come back to Dokku if Fly.io is not good for me.

These are holes I fell into...

* <code>corepack: not found</code>
Do you have a ".node-version" file in the root folder?
If not, https://github.com/rubys/dockerfile-rails/blob/main/lib/generators/templates/_install_node.erb does not work.

* <code>Alloc Unhealthy	Unhealthy because of failed task</code>
There are many reasons to trigger this error, according to their community board.
In my case, pg gem could not get downloaded while my app was deploying. The Dockerfile has "libpq-dev" so 
I didn't see what was the problem. Finally, I succeeded to avoid it by upgrading the version of Ruby from 3.1.3 to 3.2.0...
