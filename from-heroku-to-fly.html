So I tried to migrate my Rails app from Heroku to Fly and successfully failed.

These are holes I fell in...

* <code>corepack: not found</code>
Do you have a ".node-version" file in the root folder?
If not, https://github.com/rubys/dockerfile-rails/blob/main/lib/generators/templates/_install_node.erb does not work.

* <code>Alloc Unhealthy	Unhealthy because of failed task</code>
